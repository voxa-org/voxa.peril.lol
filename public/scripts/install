# Voxa Install Script for macOS (with pre-release support)
#
# This script installs Voxa by:
# 1. Checking the OS (macOS only).
# 2. Determining the release version from an argument or by fetching the latest release (including pre-releases) via GitHub API.
# 3. Constructing the download URL based on the version.
# 4. Downloading the DMG file.
# 5. Mounting the DMG.
# 6. Copying Voxa.app to /Applications.
# 7. Unmounting the DMG and cleaning up.
#
# Usage:
#   ./install_voxa.sh [version]
# Example:
#   ./install_voxa.sh 0.6.8  or  ./install_voxa.sh v0.6.8
# If no version is provided, the latest (including pre-releases) is installed.
